# Machine-Learning
 
Jupyter notebook and input/output files used for machine learning project coursework. This was my first exposure to machine learning and the code didn't need to be turned in for the course (only a report) so the jupyter notebook is a bit messy, but I cleaned it up a bit.

The project was to create a classifier for a new particle formation based on atmospheric data. The primary goal was binary classification, and the multi-label classifier is not complete.
